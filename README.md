# epic1-midterm-output: ðŸ’® Flowers For The Turtles

At first I was just playing with the turtle graphics making different classes out of them. Here i created this class I called Cardinal turtle where 4 turtles, each facing towards their appointed cardinal direction act as one. The class uses functions the same as a normal turtle but manipulates the recieved arguments to satisfy the augmented reality of the turtles in it, making the east and west turtle's x axis as y axis and their y axis as x axis.

The flowers pattern are created using the circle and triangle functions. This pattern is one of the patterns I found while playing around with the turtle graphics. I used this pattern because out of all the patterns i created, this is the one that works with the cardinal turtle the most.
